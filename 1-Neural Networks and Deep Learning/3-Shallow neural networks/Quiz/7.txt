Yes, Logistic Regression doesn't have a hidden layer. If you initialize the weights to zeros, the first example x fed in the logistic regression will output zero but the derivatives of the Logistic Regression depend on the input x (because there's no hidden layer) which is not zero. So at the second iteration, the weights values follow x's distribution and are different from each other if x is not a constant vector.
